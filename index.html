	<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
	<div id = "box">
	<p><b>Hypertext Markup Language <u>(HTML)</u></b> is standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications</p>
	<p>Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
	<p><u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &ltimg/&gt and &ltinput/&gt directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &ltp&gt surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

	<h2>Markup</h2>
	<p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called (and their <i>attributes</i>), character-based <i>data types, character references</i> and <i>entity references</i>. <u>HTML</u> tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt h1 &gt and &lt /h1 &gt, allthough some represent <i>empty elements</i> and so are unpaired, for example &ltimg&gt. The first tag in such a pair is the <i>start tag</i>, and the second is the <i>end tag</i> (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
	<p>Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> <i>document type declaration</i>, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
